### Example:
Fighting to reclaim H1 trend & H1 100 MA.

Close like this and we'll get going into NYO:
- Must hold above 107.8-108.2k
- 109.0-109.5k retest on the table if successfully flipped
- H4 EMA/MA retest and/or more chopfest if unable to do so

Therefore key fight going into today's NYO.

### Example:

- Must hold H1 300 MA & H1 200 EMA
- Must reclaim H1 trend & H1 100 MA

### Example:

A very similar fight as last Friday:
- Must hold H1 200 EMA & H1 300 MA
- Must reclaim H1 trend & H1 100 MA

Lose H1 200 EMA/H1 300 MA and we aim for the H4 EMA/MA area highlighted in H4 chart above... reclaim H1 trend x H1 100 MA = good to chill/consolidate still @ 108.5-110.5k resistance. Therefore outcome of this fight likely decides if your fav alts take a hit or not.

### Example:

On D1... still not much to say/add from recent updates:
- Our "Must break/upside target" @ 108.5-110.5k continues to act resistance
- We still want to see if D1 trend is defended into trendy behaviour or if we should expect longer chopfest

Indeed, the main interrogation remains "Do we have a new D1 trend to ride, and if not do we fill the gap to D1 100 MA by retracing or by consolidating (see end of last year example) ?"

Interesting to note that:
- D1 trend was retested last week and defended, as long as it's the case we can continue to hope some trendy behaviour for summer.
=> If/when D1 trend not defended again, that would be your STRONG signal to expect longer chopfest and set alerts @ D1 100 MA and update it day after day
=> If we get new D1 trend defended, it means new ATH inc and time to pay attention/look for plays alongside BTC exposure
- D1 100 MA now @ 98.8k
=> In confluence with mid range + lows printed end of June off of US/Iran news... great confluence to bid/play if/when retested... This would be a place I'd be interested to compound on BTC swing exposure from last year
- D1 200 EMA now @ 95.5k
- D1 300 MA now @ 90.2k
=> Entire D1 EMA/MA set still catching up nicely

So, no rush on D1, still stuck between "must break" and "must hold" (D1 trend), let market show us which side it picks:
- Hold D1 trend + new ATH = likely price discovery ahead with D1 best focus to ride
- Fail to hold D1 trend = likely turbo chopfest continuation, don't get chopped, wait for new D1 trend and/or D1 EMA/MA retests

### Example:

Last week main focuses were:
- Must hold H4 EMA/MA (100, 200, 300) if/when retested
=> Retested, defended
- Must reclaim H4 trend, move to 108.5-110.5k if reclaimed
=> Reclaimed, gave move to 108.5-110.5

And so far, we can see that this 108.5-110.5k area that has been our local top on every moves since early May is still showing strong resistance.

As discussed earlier:
- Hold H4 trend (currently being retested) and imo we give 110.5k another shot  to break
- Fail to defend H4 trend = more confirmation of LTF trappy/choppy behaviour, with another potential retest of H4 EMA/MA now in confluence with key horizontal level (our previous "must reclaim") @ 106.5+

Therefore from here:
- Hold H4 trend here, good to at least continue to chop at best a shot for new ATH
=> Keep in mind that H4 trend hasn't particularly been well respected past couple of weeks with lots of deviations above/below
=> This is some PA that we can't be surprise to have within a well defined range + during Summer
- 106.5k~ area as must hold if we see some weakness, just like last week it would be a great place for some bidding to show up
- Until we're out of the range... Continue to treat this... as a range (see labels on the right of the chart)

### Example:

It’s a new week, but the focuses are the same as last week:
- Must break 108.5-110.5k
=> rapid new ATH if/when done
- Must hold/create a new D1 trend, and the overall 104.5-106.5k
=> only chance to avoid summer chop

With the main interrogation still being "do we get a new D1 trend or do we fill the gap to D1 100 MA (by chop, or retrace) ?". And - so far - D1 trend has been defended… while 108.5-110.5k still acting as resistance.

H4/D1 focuses we’ve had have been clean and well respected, so we stick to them.

### Example:

@ H1 100 MA, must break for H4 trend reclaim confirmed as discussed earlier this weekend.

### Example:
Fighting to reclaim H4 trend, key fight that will separate a cosy weekend to a H4 gap fill weekend 🫡

### Example:
Gave this H1 200 EMA retest a shot for a long on stream and in ⁠Scalps (longs: // shorts: )... extra tight SL sub H1 200 EMA... The Whales are out to hunt me, this is the only explanations :O.

More seriously, am off for the evening and likely for the weekend.

If you remain active during the weekend:
- H4 trend must reclaim
- H4 EMA/MA must hold
- Anything in between will chop you off
With a market very news sensitive right now and after retesting key resistance during the week... Maybe not over trading and touching grass is a better idea o7

### Example:
Closed below H4 trend

H4 trend loss if H1 200 EMA doesn't show any defense, in which chase:
- H4 trend && 107.9-108.5k = must reclaim
- H4 100 MA & H4 300 MA && H4 200 EMA @ 105.8-106.2k = must hold

See latest ⁠education-pierre video about conditions for trend loss/reclaim, fitting right now.

### Example:
Giving us, on LTF going into this US holiday and beginning of 3 days weekend:
- H1 trend @ 108.8-109.2k = must reclaim
=> If/when reclaimed IMO we have a potential gap fill to local highs @ 109.0-110.0k
=> If H1 trend flipped resistance (that's the case for now) eyes on potential gap fills to H1 100 MA & H1 200 EMA @ 107.5-107.9k
- H4 trend down to 108k~ = must hold
=> H4 trend been particularly disrespected past couple of weeks, will be interesting to see if defended or not

We can clearly see why 108.5-110.5k has been our "Main upside short term target" // "this is where you take profits until proven otherwise" region.

Let's see if:
- We reclaim H1 trend or not
- We fill the gaps down to H1 200 EMA/H1 100 MA or not = could be deviation sub H4 trend for example, and enough likely to make some bloods across the board

### Example:
Totally forgot tomorrow was July 4th, which means market closing earlier today and closed tomorrow ! Could very well play a role in momentum for us but could also spare us from any negative headlines for end of the week.

Worth keeping in mind through the day depending if we get rejected here or see more strength.

In the meantime, short term focuses going into today:
BTC 108.5-110.5k must break, teleport to ATH if/when we do imo
BTC H1/H4 trends must hold, as usual LTF trends during spikes of vol are goated indicator to spot/judge whether we should expect more short term or not (ie if/when H1 trend starts to crack it can be a first good sign of small consolidation inc => see last week leg)
SPX & NYO

### Example:
BTC D1

On D1... not much to say/add:
- We're approaching ATH while in the region we printed local high/higher low in early June
- Managing to breazk this or not would confirm break in market structure
- Hard to say if we have a new D1 trend or not, got retested and defended earlier this week but while being flat... We can hope so

In any case IF that was to be "it" again unfortunately (hope not... structure is very promising, hopefully burgers and boomers don't ruin this) D1 EMA/MA structure is getting higher and higher, would set up for nice continuation into rest of the year.

It's gonna be a big fight today and rest of the week to break ATH and defend D1 trend, but this is getting interesting and could very well (hopefully) invalidate the summer chop scenario.

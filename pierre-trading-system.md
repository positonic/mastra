## Lessons

### Risk management

First it's important to understand that there are no golden/ideal rules when it comes to risk and trade management. It depends on your lifestyle, on how much you're willing to risk... your overall trading strategy.

I'll answer briefly here a couple of questions I've had recently, this is my personal opinion and approach. It fits me and is the result of a couple of years of experience trading altcoins. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Find a risk management strategy that fits the way you trade, not somebody else.

### **What is the maximum number of alt positions you can have / maximum % of altcoins you can have in your folio at a certain time / simultaneously?**

We all know there are multiple best and worst case scenario, or context, environment, to trade altcoins.

The two most obvious and easiest context and environment are:

1) Bitcoin is in a context favorable to altcoins, price is ranging or trending slowly without peak of volatility.

2) Bitcoin is a context of uncertainty approaching a technical level of interest, this creates an hostile environment to altcoins, despite a few lone runners (often called Huobi season).

*In the context of 1):*

Whenever altcoins are having a run like we had in May *(for context, this post was written shortly after the COVID crash)* it can happen for me to have up to 50% of my entire folio in altcoins exposure.

I rarely have more than this, as I consider it being already a lot. It often means that it's a moment I'm fully dedicated to trading altcoins, and altcoins only, and that I have extra time to manage these positions/scan the market more precisely.

Having half of your trading folio in altcoins is already considered as a degen risk for many, and it's highly understandable to think so considering how volatile this market is.

Again, this is a personal approach.

I insist, this happens when I am really confident enough that altcoins won't get affected much by Bitcoin movements, or because I believe it won't move much (Price ranging like we've had since the beggining of May, it was a great hint).

Therefore as a first conclusion, we can say that:

***Always having a focus and good understanding of the context of trading in which Bitcoin is, is a major component of altcoins trading risk management.***

You can always look for isolated trends, often happening on Huobi, altcoins completely uncorrelated with Bitcoin, however this is a rare event and it's very often better to have the mentality shared above.

*In context of 2):*

In times, like right now (June 10th 2020), where I'm indeed expecting volatility from Bitcoin after weeks of ranging, it tends (bear market PTSD) to give me doubt about any altcoin strength continuation.

Therefore, I'm looking to reduce my altcoins exposure (not necessarily my BTC exposure).

It means that in my (it's personal, again no golden/ideal approaches, all of them have multiple pros and cons), trading system I'll try to keep less than 5% risk ON for altcoins. Or no more than 2 "freshly" opened positions (I always keep my risk per trade of 2%, this is what defines later my size position based on my invalidation).

As I'm very uncertain about current Bitcoin context this is the maximum that I allow myself to have. I'll most likely won't open any new position until I have more clarity (in the coming days/by the end of the week).

***It gives me more time either to manage still opened position, either to scan more and get ready in case of continuation.***

As a second conclusion, a very obvious one, we can say that:

***You can reduce your risk by reducing exposure/taking profits over the board whenever you're not confident in altcoins anymore. However this lack of confident should ALWAYS be motivated by a clear Bitcoin (and potentially other tools like bitcoin dominance, volume study, ....) study/analysis.***

### Core components of system

### **The Three Core Components of my System: The Constant Research of the Best Confluence**

In the past few weeks to months I've spent a lot of time sharing examples of what I believed to be the best setups in term of confluence - and what it means in my system. My main goal doing so is for you guys to have "simple" checklist to have when browsing a chart and looking for setups.

I have a very simple approach when it comes to trading: I want to have the better understanding possible of the strength/weakness of current trend (doesn't matter the TF, from 15 min to D1/W1) and cycle we're in.

Already discussed this multiple times but I tend to think moving averages in their structures are very good indicators for that. I have already made educational content about what I often refer to as "the trend" = the 13/25 EMA couple. With experience I can tell this couple of EMA is a very strong indicator of short/mid term trends from 15 min to D1.

Over the past few months, focusing on these "trend reclaim" or "trend retest" we managed to spot early almost all ETH/BTC reversal (on LTF -> 15min to H1) and BTC entire trend as D1 trend has been intact from 10.5 to 33k and then reclaimed from 35k to now (51k).

Recent LTF PA on Bitcoin (time this content is written is Feb 2021) has been another perfect example as you can see on this chart - BTC/USDT - H4 - Feb 2021

***What do I look for in order of priority when looking for a setup?***

**1) Horizontal S/R flips and/or pivot**

**2) Trend (13/25 EMA)**

**3) Stoch RSI at cycle low.**

If/when you get the confluence of the three, you often get a VERY clean invalidation.

Stoch RSI only comes 3d as a confirmation of the above and tool to time entries best way possible.

Stoch RSI settings I use are "Binance default" settings = K 3 ; D 3 ; Length RSI 9 ; Length stoch 14 ; Close

Some great examples:

**In downtrend H4 trend retest based setup=**

- Entry = as close as possible to H4 trend + horizontal retest and ideally overbought
- Invalidation= above confluence
- Target #1 = previous lows

**In uptrend H4 trend retest based setup=**

- Entry = as close as possible to H4 trend + horizontal retest and ideally oversold
- Invalidation = below confluence
- Target #1 = previous highs

**Why the importance of overbought/oversold?**

Because in terms of momentum it's a good a way to gauge H4 trend strength:

- In downtrend = if we bounce without reclaiming any significant Horizontal level or break/reclaim trend while getting to overbought == weakness expecting downtrend continuation
- In uptrend = if we retrace without losing any significant Horizontal level or break trend while getting to oversold == strength expecting uptrend continuation

This is all you need, take your time and try to find these kind of setups!

### What is trend

- What I refer to as "the trend" on my charts is the structure formed by: 13, 25 and 32 EMA.
- It's the same on all time frames, I don't change it ever.
- The wider the gaps between 13, 25 and 32 the more violent the trend/recent move is, the higher chances of over extension and need to reset.
- The tighter the gaps between 13, 25 and 32 the higher chance "trend is reset" and/or being retested, the higher chances resolution/next impulse is coming.
- 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA as "main gap focuses" i.e targets for upside/downside when trends lost

### ***What do you consider a "solid reclaim?”***

The exact same thing as my "three core components" of my system.

What I want to see is this:

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/47dd5bc2-518d-4784-f2c5-00752391bc00/full)

A perfect reclaim for me is a reclaim of the confluence of horizontal level + H4 trend.

But for it to be IDEAL (in my opinion) I want to see H4 Stoch reset when the retest happens.

Whenever this happens it's a go for me most of the time.

    enter the rest
    

### ***When do I consider a trend lost?***

It's a personal approach, you can adapt this as much as you want so it can fit your risk management.

Personally I consider a trend lost when :

- Close (on the Time Frame of preference) below 10-30 EMA (or whatever your preference is to show short term trend),
- Retest from below and rejection.

A recent good example of I manage trend retests has been BTC/USDT D1.

Initial plan was to long a retest of $60,000-62,000 area, confluence of horizontal + D1 trend.

It ended up being lost, and the way I reacted:

- Instantly de risked after first daily close below this confluence
- Waited for retest from below of the D1 trend + 59/60k confluence
- De risked/exited more on rejections at this level (while taking scalps in between to reduce loss).

    Hello everyone, welcome for a new Woop Educational Library video. Today we are going to be discussing and answering one of the main questions I've had through the years from other members which is when do you consider a trend to be lost? Obviously with the trend following system. Aspect of the market of the system and it is a crucial aspect because this is this set of rules that are going to help us identify and understand when we should be first taking personal profits or all profits depending on what was our initial plan and adapt the way we're approaching the market. We have three core components of the system, the EMA/MA compression that leads into trend following that leads into cap fields and into compression. The trend following window is obviously the one where we want to be making the market as much as possible. This is the window where we want to be playing as aggressively as possible because the market has to be much more forgivable while when the trend stops we want to avoid any kind of reversal or chop fest to give back any profits. Therefore being able to answer this question is obviously a crucial part of the system. When I started to build that system the two main issues I had were indeed knowing when to sell. I was very good at buying like anyone else but I was one flipping a lot my profit and I was always I always struggled to understand when was the end of the trendy behavior and or I was continuing to play as aggressively as we did during the trendy environments and I was getting chopped enough to give back a lot of profits. So being able to answer this question should help fixing this issue or at least working on fixing this issue. I personally came with a set of two rules that I'm going to explain but before that I just want to insist that there is no set in stone rules it's just imaginary lines on the charts. You can work with these two rules as a basis but I strongly advise you to play around with the system see how it can fit within your approach and if you need more or less rules regarding that depending on how aggressively you tend to be on the market. So personally when do I consider a trend to be lost? I will consider a trend to be lost when first we close below the trend. So we could definitely up just this rule and it would make sense. A close below the trend means that the trend is lost. However through the years and if you play it around with the system we can see that it happens often like with any system that we have deviations so we close below the trend but eventually very rapidly the trend is reclaimed. Leading into is our continuation of the trend or job best and consolidation? So I wanted to work on something a confirmation of the first rule to try to fix that and to fix this I realized that I could focus on the minus 1.200 EMA and whether it was lost or defended. Meaning that for example if I'm riding the daily trend and we start the day below the daily trend through the year or through the day sorry I'm going to be I'm going to go on age 4 and watch whether age 4 200 EMA is dependent on us. If we are deviating below the daily trend and age 4 200 EMA is not dependent on the day this can be an early signal that the track is going to be is lost.
    
    And that I should expect at least job best and maybe reversal. So that should be enough of a signal to take partial profits or full profits again depends on your approach and take a step back. If H4200MA is defended, there are chances that this is a deviation that could lead into trend continuation. And therefore, I want to stick into the position and wait to see if H4200MA continues to be defended. So close below the trends. And if you want to have a confirmation of that, you go on H4 and you check if H4200MA is defended on it. This is applicable to any time frames. If I'm riding on H4 trend and we start closing or deviating below the H4 trend, I will watch H1 200MA. If I'm riding on H1 trend, I will go and check 15 minutes 100MA. So you can apply that everywhere depending on how you're approaching the market. So let's take a look at a few examples we've had and the outcomes that we had with it. As I said, a close below the trends can mean to me can mean two things, three things. One, deviation into trend continuation. Two, deviation into job best. Three, the trend is broken. For the first scenario, deviation into trend continuation, what you want to see is H4200MA being defended in the case of a daily trend, obviously. If we have a close below the trend, but H4200MA is defended, I will personally assume that it has a chance to be a deviation into continuation. If we have a close below the trend and H4200MA lost, that will be the two other scenarios. Either job best, either reversal. In both cases, the conclusion is the same. I want to take my profits and I want to take a step back. Let things unfold. Let potential job best unfold, potential cap fields unfold and I will wait for the next trend deviator. Let's take a look. So we've had an example during the last couple of last few weeks on Bitcoin.
    
    ![image.png](attachment:22ea8d76-b897-4883-b2d5-0baeecd0e114:image.png)
    

![image.png](attachment:06ecc6e1-a9cb-48c1-8f66-443ea58b9459:image.png)

I had an example during the last couple of last few weeks on Bitcoin. We can see that we've had daily close, below daily trends. We go on H4 and we can see that H4 200 Gmail was not defended, which to me was much was more of a confirmation of the scenario we've had of the past two weeks, which was EMA/MA compression and therefore Chalk Fest. That was an additional confirmation of that scenario. If we go a little bit more in the back, if I remember correctly in those two examples, we've had actually two of the main scenarios. We can see here that we have a daily close, below daily trends. Do we consider that as the trend to be broken or as in the chance of being a deviation? We're going to check H4 200 Gmail and we can see that indeed we have H4 200 being defended. That daily close does not constitute enough of weakness for us to consider the daily trend to be broken. At this point, we are expecting trend continuation until H4 200MA is broken. We can see that a couple of weeks later, we have another close, below daily trends. A much more significant close, below daily trends. This time, we can see that indeed H4 200MA is broken, not only broken, but also flip resistance. This time, compared to the previous retests, we have a confirmation that the trend is broken and it's enough to consider that we need to take profits and take a step back. In these retests and these daily close, below daily trends, this avoided us selling a potential bottom and have an opportunity to sell higher a few weeks later. It was indeed a deviation. While in this case, we have daily trend close, below daily trends and H4 200MA is broken. That's two examples for Bitcoin, two examples which led to chop, fast and continuation and one to reversal. One of the main examples we've had and we used over the past few, over the past couple of years at least, but particularly during the last few months was the ePTC daily downtrend. For the vast majority of the last two years, we've been focused on the daily downtrend on Bitcoin, on ePTC. As a main indicator, we wanted to be focused on e if Bitcoin and until ePTC was in the daily downtrend, we didn't want it to focus on ePTC. We kept saying because of our set of rules that the day we would have daily close, above daily trend plus H4 200MA, lived and defended, we would flip or focus back from Eve to BTC.

![image.png](attachment:d2d83505-9e7e-4163-beaf-d90d504710b6:image.png)

From BTC to EAP, sorry. So we have a few examples. For example, here we have the daily trend that closes. We have daily that closes above the daily trend, but we can see that H4200MA is acting as resistance and R is we close about it. But instantly we fail to flip it super strong signal that this is a deviation. Over here we have a daily close above daily trend, but we can see that H4200MA is defended, acting as resistance. So it's likely to be a deviation. While at this time not only we have daily trend above daily close, but we can see that H4200MA is broken. This is a very good example of when you don't want to wait necessarily for the daily to close before making a decision. In that example, seeing that we were deviating above the daily downtrend and that H4200MA was completely blasted through was a good intraday signal that the daily trend is going to break and that you want to play more aggressively and you don't want to wait for the daily close. It's enough of a signal that we're going to see more strength. And it's even more clear on the E-FUSDT chart. So we can see strong daily downtrend with a couple of deviations where just like on the E-BTC chart, we can see that we break through H4200MA, but we immediately fail to flip it super, likely a deviation. It's happened a couple of times on the way down, while at this moment we have a close above daily trend, but very slightly close above daily trend. If you don't have a set of rules, whether you want to say if the trend is lost or not, you could have decided not to focus on if because of that daily trend, daily close. Because you've seen it in the past, we closed above the daily trend, but it ended up being failures. So in that example, it was to me in the recent weeks, one of the biggest examples of the application of the system. You can see that on lower time frame, H4200MA this time is well-dependent, which is a strong difference between the previous times we tried to break through it, where in a matter of a couple of candles, we were already below it. This time, not only we closed above it, but H4200MA flipped perfectly support, and that was a strong signal that the daily downtrend was finally broken.

![image.png](attachment:4adbb2cb-bb8f-4d9e-92fe-7ca2bec8c44d:image.png)

And personally, if you've been in my trading channels, you know that we've been shorting it a lot on the way down. That we were shorting that H400MA retest because that was a daily trend retest and we've been shorting it on the daily trend retest. But as soon as we closed above, we took off the shots and we were looking to flip long. We didn't wait for the daily to close, but intraday, the H400MA being defended was a very good and early signal of the trends to be broken. The daily downtrend to be broken and therefore to expect a new trend to the upside. So one last example on hype this time. And this example is for close below the trends, but there are deviations. As I said earlier, one of the reasons I ended up working with that H400MA or minus one time frame 200MA, not only H400MA, again it works on all time frames. Was that as much as the system can be cleaned, we're going to have deviations like any system. If you play with, if you mostly work with horizontal level, you're going to have some time we're going to deviate below the horizontal level or horizontal region and it end up being a deviation. So we want to minimize the impact of those deviations. And that's why we have this minus one time frame 200MA. All those examples we have close below the H400. If you're riding the H400 and your rule is simply close below means trend lost, you would likely have sold every time we add these clauses. While if you have this additional rule of minus one time frame 200MA.

![image.png](attachment:90a03d35-9981-4f76-8cb9-2a3b14b8c73d:image.png)

- 1 time frame 200mm being depended on it. We're gonna see that all of those retests were H1 200mm retest. They were not very very clean H1 200mm retest. Again, it doesn't have to be perfect. But you can see that all of these were H1 200mm regions retest. And every time they were depended, if you were riding the trend, you knew that you could stick to the trend. And that if at some point H1 200mm was truly lost and broken and fixed resistance, that was just strong signal to expect job best. Alright, so that's it for today's video. I believe that it's nothing new for those who have been following the system for a while, who are in streams asking questions. But I felt like I needed to make that video because, again, it's a question I have on a daily basis. On every stream I have people asking me this question. It's already written in a few places of my educational library. For example, when we are playing the gap field system, in the template of the setup, in the conditions that I shared, you can see that I have two conditions. And in those two conditions, you have trend lost 200 EMA minus time frame minus one, sorry, broken, as conditions to be expecting gap fields and reversals. And it's a condition every time I'm going to be discussing whether a trend is broken or not, that these are going to be my two main conditions. So if you have any questions regarding this approach, again, as usual, Don't hesitate to ask a question.

### Using Stoch RSI

**Using Stochastic RSI within trend while looking for weakness/strength in momentum**

- Within an uptrend: If an asset goes back from overbought to oversold without losing any significant horizontal level (support) and/or trend (on the time frame we're focused on) then that's a sign of strength => Expecting trend (up) continuation
- Within a downtrend: If an asset goes back from oversold to overbought without reclaiming any significant horizontal level (resistance) and/or trend (on the time frame we're focused on) then that's a sign of weakness => Expecting trend (down) continuation

Said differently:

If market is approaching an horizontal resistance and/or trend (even better in confluence) from below and Stoch RSI is overbought I consider this as a short opportunity.

If market is approaching an horizontal support and/or trend (even better in confluence) from above and Stoch RSI is oversold I consider this as a long opportunity.

If market is within an uptrend, and it goes from overbought to oversold without losing any significant (important) horizontal level and/or trend (even better on confluence) I consider this as a sign of strong momentum within the trend and usually higher risk.

If market is within a downtrend, and it goes from oversold to overbought without reclaiming any significant (important) horizontal level and/or trend (even better on confluence) I consider this as a sign of weakness momentum within the trend and usually use have more confidence in the short side.

### **Simplified Approach to Trade Management**

The overall and OVERLY SIMPLIFIED approach I have is:

- Is XXX is D1 uptrend ?

Yes -> Look primarily for long on H4 trend retests,

No -> Don’t even think about longs.

- Is XXX in H4 uptrend within D1 uptrend ?

Yes -> Continue to chase longs on H4 trend retests as long as defended,

No -> Wait for H4 uptrend to be reclaimed or D1 uptrend lower to be retested before considering adding/re entering -> IE either play the gap fills lower, either wait for retests.

**The D1 trend will affect my general bias toward XXX, the H4 trend will often affect how I actively manage the position.**

I have a rule for when the H4 trend does NOT get respected (lost and reclaimed constantly), and it’s usually to stay the fuck out and come back to a D1 focus until chart « reset » (ie H4 trend flat, H4 100 MA and H4 200 EMA at same value than H4 trend).

So I have a set of additional rules:

- I never bid a first trend retest after reclaim (ie I never bid D1 trend retest from above after a period of D1 downtrend for example, it often helps avoiding traps).
- I always prefer bidding H4 trend reclaims than D1 trend retests (because once D1 trend retested and H4 trend reclaimed you have strength confirmations and are most likely buying into momentum [see early Jan H4 trend + H4 200 EMA reclaim on BTC, or even last week 21.8-22.0k reclaim to have an understanding of what I’m saying],
- If H4 trend not respected most likely means asset needs consolidation period == most likely not interesting to actively scalp == stay focus on D1 trend and don’t get chopped for nothing.

A few H4 200 EMA examples

Just wanted to share these two examples of the power of H4 200 EMA on trending assets. Simply entering and exiting on reclaim/losses of H4 200 EMA would have been one hell of a swing trade on LINK/USDT and MKR/USDT.

Keep an eye on this one and become a 200 EMA maximalist like myself. kek

Charts:

**MKR/USDT - H4**

**LINK/USDT - H4**

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/2975a141-ce79-4ebd-b0ca-9813bc1add00/full)

### **Trend Fakeouts**

**In order to avoid fake outs/traps BOTH WAYS I tend not to:**

- Long/short on first retest of a trend that just got broken (I most often don't long the first retest from above, most often don't short the first retest from below.

*However I can use these as signs of reversal and to de risk.*

- Long/short if attempt of reclaim/reversal happens in overbought territory in case of upside, oversold territory in case of downside.

**You will never be able to avoid all fake outs...**

But if we take May-July 2021 crash into reversal, or current downtrend since November 2021, both gave -50% moves on BTC with ONE single fake out until reversal... That's still vastly better than those trying to knife catch all the way down. If you see that D1 trend gets unclear = reclaimed, then rapidly lost and so on -> You stay the fuck out, market is about to get very boring (I don't remember a time I've seen this on BTC).

So what is an "ideal reclaim" in my book?

- Retest of trend that just got broken (to the upside), and defense,
- In confluence with horizontal if possible (adds clarity to the invalidation),
- And in a perfect world with Stoch reset on the time frame picked.

    how to avoid traps there is something
    
    **0:02**
    
    that I very often say and you will see
    
    **0:04**
    
    it if you watch the one one session with
    
    **0:05**
    
    flipper is that whenever I'm following a
    
    **0:08**
    
    strong Trend and we have potential break
    
    **0:11**
    
    of it whether it's to the upside or to
    
    **0:13**
    
    the downside we can use plenty of
    
    **0:15**
    
    example from Bitcoin where we had
    
    **0:17**
    
    potential deviations below Trend a lot
    
    **0:19**
    
    of weird things happening and in the end
    
    **0:21**
    
    it was just h1200 Ma retests so what I'm
    
    **0:23**
    
    trying to say is that whenever you try
    
    **0:25**
    
    to assess if a trend is breaking or not
    
    **0:28**
    
    like it was trying to do on Tuesday a
    
    **0:31**
    
    second confirmation you can have is
    
    **0:33**
    
    whether the 200 EMA on the time frame
    
    **0:36**
    
    minus one so in that case we on H4 we
    
    **0:39**
    
    would look at H1 is it broken or not if
    
    **0:41**
    
    you have H4 closing above H4 Trend then
    
    **0:44**
    
    you're like oh okay that might be the
    
    **0:46**
    
    break but if you want a second
    
    **0:48**
    
    confirmation you go into H1 and you see
    
    **0:50**
    
    if we broke H1 to Ma and your two
    
    **0:52**
    
    triggers can be to consider the HF Trend
    
    **0:55**
    
    broken I want to see h1200 M broken and
    
    **0:58**
    
    h1100 M flip support if we are at H4
    
    **1:02**
    
    Trend and you start seeing h1200 in a
    
    **1:05**
    
    break it's likely a signal that we could
    
    **1:07**
    
    have a break out and H4 Trend break into
    
    **1:10**
    
    a gap field to h400 dma so that can be
    
    **1:12**
    
    your trigger at the opposite if we don't
    
    **1:14**
    
    get h1200 dma and we consolidate a
    
    **1:17**
    
    little bit in between your second
    
    **1:18**
    
    trigger that this going to end as a
    
    **1:21**
    
    failed reclaim and rejection from 8 for
    
    **1:23**
    
    Trend is losing h1200 so two things you
    
    **1:26**
    
    want to see h1200 broken and if h100 ma
    
    **1:29**
    
    is is not defended you likely end up
    
    **1:31**
    
    with a strong rediction and not
    
    **1:33**
    
    necessarily strong but at least
    
    **1:35**
    
    rediction and in yesterday updates when
    
    **1:37**
    
    we came for the H4 TR retest I insisted
    
    **1:39**
    
    in my channel to keep an eye on h1100 Ma
    
    **1:42**
    
    defense and or h1200 ma retest if we
    
    **1:45**
    
    were coming for the h1200 retest be
    
    **1:48**
    
    careful with local top and you want to
    
    **1:49**
    
    see it broken if that was a low but if
    
    **1:51**
    
    we fail to defend h1100 May it's likely
    
    **1:54**
    
    a first signal to be cautious and that
    
    **1:56**
    
    it should have been defended if we had a
    
    **1:58**
    
    chance to break the H4 downtrend and as
    
    **2:00**
    
    you can see we closed above it
    
    **2:02**
    
    immediately closed ear after that unable
    
    **2:04**
    
    to flip h11 so far potential first sign
    
    **2:07**
    
    of H4 Trend rejection and then it f
    
    **2:09**
    
    resistance and we ended up with stronger
    
    **2:11**
    
    H4 down Trend rejection so why am I
    
    **2:14**
    
    telling you guys all of that because
    
    **2:16**
    
    it's something that I've discussed this
    
    **2:17**
    
    morning for Sana because Sana is in a
    
    **2:20**
    
    similar situation than Bitcoin was
    
    **2:23**
    
    yesterday which is trying to break H4
    
    **2:25**
    
    downtrend so if we keep in mind what we
    
    **2:28**
    
    all just discussed what you want to have
    
    **2:30**
    
    an H4 downtrend break you want to see
    
    **2:32**
    
    h1100 May defended and h1200 may broken

### **Using LTF Trends to Avoid Fakeouts**

**Using Moving Averages in order to find trends on lower time frames:**

Some things to study for everyone:

If you've been paying attention to my content since the beginning, you most likely noticed that we have avoided MANY times any kind of FOMO and timed most of our exits quite well. I've shared how and why in various updates but I wanted to summarize it using 3 examples. I believe this is something important to understand if you want do dig deeper into my thought process / trading system.

Notes on chart.

**UNI/USDT - H1**

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/53756af5-71c8-4c12-1d7e-2b269d75f400/full)

**YFII/USDT - H4**

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/3ea50a03-9b4a-4549-63a0-5fc4a3d82600/full)

### **Chasing Shorts within D1 Uptrend**

The same way I'm MAINLY looking for longs in D1 up trends and MAINLY looking for shorts in D1 downtrends, I tend to think that in current market conditions you'll very often have a better business chasing long setups than weakness across the board.

HOWEVER, we've seen in 2022 that despite strong D1 downtrends, we often had good opportunities for longs on GAP FILLS/PLAYS on lower time frame (very often H4).

**Meaning:**

- H4 trend loss withing D1 uptrend and flipped resistance,
- Potential short aiming for gap plays/fills lower to H4 100 MA and H4 200 EMA.

These can be very good hedges for rest of your market exposure (most likely mainly long due to market conditions).

Therefore, yes on the example you shared it could have been/is a great short opportunity but have to be approached while keeping a good understanding of the high time frame environment and that it MIGHT not be the best plays for not.

**I would add the following focuses/factors to have if looking for SHORTS in D1 uptrend and green market:**

- Focus on chasing them MORE if/when BTC & ETH show signs of weakness such as H4 trend loss (not lost once in this entire rally so far, so no trigger on that part SO FAR),
- End of a narrative = for example a coin that moved off of a strong narrative/event which is now gone.

**So if I summarize, if you're looking for SHORTS within D1 UPTRENDS your main signals should be:**

1) Low time frame trends lost and flipped resistance (i.e H1/H4 trends lost),

2) Wide gaps to play below (meaning the asset moved a LOT and it's interesting to play the gaps, don't short a H4 trend loss if H4 200 EMA is right below, this might not be as interesting),

3) BTC & ETH showing signs of weakness too (H4 trend lost for example),

4) Dying/dead narrative.

**Reminder:**

When taking a trade counter trending an HTF trend you want several conditions:

- H4 trend reclaimed and defended,
- H4 100 MA & H4 200 EMA as your main targets,

=> They represent the trend on higher TF, as you’re long within D1 downtrend you must pay yourself when retesting D1 downtrend

- Wide gaps between H4 trend and H4 100 MA & H4 200 EMA

=> The wider the gaps mean the most interesting the setup because the bigger the move to capture

Therefore it’s perfectly fine to long/short on H4 within up/down trends on D1, but you just need big gaps (come after big moves in HTF trend direction -> meaning that you’ll get big gaps on H4 after a strong/brutal D1 trend [it’s just math and averages :)]) to play with.

It’s really just all about playing gaps, if you’ve been studying and paying attention to my system/content and particularly all the "trend x compression" patterns discussed in the other chapters, then it makes perfect sense.

Here’s a clip of me talking about making money both ways, people are often too focused on only longs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_RwaJx1vPM

- transcript
    
    is like so many of us have been trying
    
    **0:01**
    
    to catch Longs instead of just focusing
    
    **0:03**
    
    on shorting when all Trends are aligned
    
    **0:06**
    
    to the downside and I'm guilty of that I
    
    **0:08**
    
    think there have been a couple of
    
    **0:10**
    
    factors for that it's something that
    
    **0:11**
    
    I've very often discussed over the past
    
    **0:13**
    
    couple of months is that for me
    
    **0:15**
    
    personally I've missed an entire cycle
    
    **0:18**
    
    of shorting in alts I've sold in March
    
    **0:20**
    
    most of the alts and since March I went
    
    **0:23**
    
    from having 10 Freds in a row mostly
    
    **0:26**
    
    longs to stop trading ads and having a
    
    **0:29**
    
    Fred ear and there and giving a shot for
    
    **0:31**
    
    a long ear and there basically I was
    
    **0:33**
    
    happy enough with the fact that I sold
    
    **0:36**
    
    that I didn't even try to focus on
    
    **0:37**
    
    shoting them which is like eating a
    
    **0:39**
    
    pizza arriving halfway through it and be
    
    **0:41**
    
    like oh it's great and stop
    
    **0:43**
    
    eating it instead of just finishing the
    
    **0:45**
    
    Pizza I think it was a bad thing
    
    **0:47**
    
    these guys did a good thing basically
    
    **0:49**
    
    because it was a good thing realizing
    
    **0:51**
    
    that it was probably time to back out of
    
    **0:53**
    
    alss and likely lower the frequency of
    
    **0:56**
    
    trading and be a little bit more focused
    
    **0:58**
    
    on bitcoin but it was also a shitty
    
    **1:01**
    
    decision because as much as I wrote Tia
    
    **1:03**
    
    to the upside I also missed that insane
    
    **1:05**
    
    daily downtrend the worst part of it is
    
    **1:08**
    
    that I tried to long that break of daily
    
    **1:10**
    
    downtrend it was instantly invalidated
    
    **1:13**
    
    and this could and this should have been
    
    **1:16**
    
    enough for me to tell myself okay if
    
    **1:18**
    
    this doesn't play out anymore it's
    
    **1:20**
    
    and I should short it which I did
    
    **1:22**
    
    not despite everything we say and all
    
    **1:25**
    
    the trash we say on the market we kind
    
    **1:27**
    
    of still have a primary long based and
    
    **1:30**
    
    subconscious bulbas of the market I
    
    **1:32**
    
    think I'm guilty of it I've been trying
    
    **1:34**
    
    to work on it one thing that I've
    
    **1:36**
    
    noticed helped me fighting that is that
    
    **1:39**
    
    when I'm inv validated on the setup I
    
    **1:41**
    
    keep it on top of my watch list I give
    
    **1:44**
    
    it 24 to 48 hours depending on the time
    
    **1:47**
    
    frame but most of my trades are age for
    
    **1:48**
    
    daily so I leave them a couple of days
    
    **1:50**
    
    to develop and if when I come back to it
    
    **1:53**
    
    we are still around my invalidation on a
    
    **1:55**
    
    long for example and we are stuck below
    
    **1:57**
    
    it's an instantly short for me I force
    
    **1:59**
    
    myself to take it it's not R trading
    
    **2:01**
    
    anymore because took couple of days to
    
    **2:02**
    
    develop and it's still below what was
    
    **2:04**
    

### Patterns on particular assets

One thing you can notice about trading altcoins is that a vast majority of them tend to print very similar patterns/structures over time.

Either on High Time Frame (HTF), where we can agree most of them have been down trending since 2017/2018 top, or Low Time Frame (LTF) where we can spot incredible similarities across the board.

Being able to identify these structures can be a very effective way to scan and look for potential setups.

Indeed, whenever altcoins tend to trend, they do it all together and you don't want to be rushing into altcoins that have already moved. Main question remains to be able to spot the ones ready to follow and make the best out of them.

This is the main goal of this post as I'll share a very good example of a pattern that got repeated multiple times during the last 10 days (May 2020) on Binance.

**The Confluence of Horizontal S/R Flip and H4 200 EMA**

As mentioned above, the pattern I'll describe below is a pattern that we've seen all over Binance during the last 10/15 days, but is mainly a pattern you'll see on multiple time frames and over multiple periods of time.

It is one of my favorite setup as it is based on the confluence of two of the most important things I'm looking for when scanning and looking for setups:

- An Horizontal S/R flip,
- A 200 EMA flip on H4 Time Frame (TF).

In the case of this post we will indeed focus on the H4 TF, which I is the one I'm using the most.

**Below is the structure we’ll be looking for:**

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/37561ed3-cab8-4e83-0c25-88e747b74a00/full)

For this example, I decided to use $AE - a Binance coin showing the perfect setup.

In order to identify an horizontal S/R flip, we'll be looking for a level that has showed signs of support (provided bounces) and resistance (provided rejection).

The strength of this setup will be the confluence of this S/R flip with the flip of H4 200 EMA, a major trend indicator on multiple TF.

Once the horizontal level is identified, we'll be waiting for a breakout. This is when the coin gets on top of your watch list.

Next step will be to wait for a retest of this level.

Two approaches are possible:

1) Set up entries at the confluence of horizontal level and H4 200 EMA waiting for an entry, with invalidation below.

2) Wait for a retest and confirmed bounce to enter.

First approach might give you a better entry, but can be quickly invalidated in a case of a fake out.

Second approach is a bit more conservative but would give you a better idea of the strength of the setup.

The real interest I have in these kind of setups is the simplicity to spot them, and the clarity of the invalidation. Fake out can be easily identified if the confluence of S/R and 200 EMA flip isn't showing signs of strength, and therefore many mistakes can be avoided. Indeed, if you go with the most conservative approach of waiting for a bounce and flip confirmed, the invalidation of your setup is even clearer.

As you can see, 200 EMA flip is mainly used as an indicator of strength and potential trend flip.

**A few examples & results**

I listed below a few examples of similar setups I’ve been taking on Binance during the last 10 days so you can have a better understanding of how the setup looks like.

**AE / 5.18R:**

Here is a perfect example of what I shared above with $ALGO / $BTC on the H4 TF.

I left notes on the chart to illustrate it a bit better, that way it should help you find some similar setups more easily and not chase coins that already pumped.

As mentioned above, this kind of patterns are very common and as you can see, they're quite interesting by the simplicity and the rewards they offer with such a clean invalidation.

### **Using the H4 trend in a downtrend or uptrend**

**In downtrend H4 trend retest based setup =** - Entry = as close as possible to H4 trend + horizontal retest and ideally overbought - Invalidation= above confluence - Target #1 = previous lows

**In uptrend H4 trend retest based setup =** - Entry = as close as possible to H4 trend + horizontal retest and ideally oversold - Invalidation = below confluence - Target #1 = previous highs

**Why the importance of overbought/oversold ?** Because in terms of momentum it's a good a way to gauge H4 trend strength: - In downtrend = if we bounce without reclaiming any significant Horizontal level or break/reclaim trend while getting to overbought == weakness expecting downtrend continuation - In uptrend = if we retrace without losing any significant Horizontal level or break trend while getting to oversold == strength expecting uptrend continuation

A clip of me talking about entering on retests:

### Avoiding Chop

### ***How do you define chop within your system, where you say, “I am not interested in taking trades in this region?”***

Usually after a period of trending, the first loss of H4 trend is the signal for me to get out and/or to at least cool off a bit. It's not a set in stone rule and it doesn't mean that every time that the trend is lost it's just gone, sometimes there are fake outs but usually the loss of 13 EMA is a very good indicator that the ongoing trend could use some reset.

Usually for me it goes like this:

- 13 EMA lost? First signal to be cautious, potential end of trend and/or chop coming. Example:

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/a6846abd-f594-4365-cfec-608d96722900/full)

- Rest of trend lost? Confirmation of weakness, get out. Example:

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/8f354a04-51f4-4494-a9d5-7fe6e8f45600/full)

*Why 13 EMA?*

The most aggressive EMA I use as trend indicator, meaning that 13 EMA defended == strong trend, 13 EMA lost == trend weakening

### ***"If we start losing trends/levels, when do you except chop and when do you expect more downside continuation?"***

**Quick answer:**

In downtrends particularly when playing BTC (mostly spot plays) it's same for me in terms of positioning (chopfest or continuation I want to be flat anyway).

**However if in uptrend particularly:**

1. If/when trend reclaimed/lost + horizontal defended/flipped resistance

2. Bounce to recent highs/Lows

3. But fail to break it

4. Then expect longer period of consolidation/chop until higher period MA/EMA (100/200 most of the time for me) reset (catch down/up with price and get flat)

**The context also plays a big role:**

1. Are we in a strong trend that has been defended for a while ?

=> If yes then of course I'll give it more VALUE for being lost or reclaimed

2. Are we in a choppy market, with no clear HTF trend and lots of indecision amongst market participants ?

=> If yes then loss/reclaim of trends won't have as much impact to me

Some things I like to focus on to try understanding/spotting this as early as possible:

- The gaps between trend and 100 MA/200 EMA, the wider the better
- If after a big move we have a bounce into LTF trends and they can't break = chop likely until things reset and market heals (talked about these hundreds of times in the group)
- If the trend + 100 MA / 200 EMA are flat or not

So TL;DR:

- Usually if/when trend lost or reclaimed we fail to print continuation (retest of recent highs/lows rejected) then expect longer period of chop until 100 MA / 200 EMA reset
- Context matters, it's good to understand chart but it's crucial to understand overall market trend

### **Avoiding FOMO During Macro Events**

For this topic, I will use FOMC & Powell Speech as the example.

Market tend to have a first wave of volatility whenever the data are out, people then tend to rush into positions while we **very often** see a wave #2 of volatility during/for Powell speech. So whenever the data are out, don't ape, see which side wins the battle.

Also, usually if market prints a big move in a direction (up or down) and the retraces, if you position/fade the first impulse you rarely want to see the extreme of the wick retested. Meaning:

- If market tanks into the data and is rapidly bought up, if longing you usually don't want to see the lows printed during that leg retested => If that happens it often means that the bounce is weak AND/OR that at **best** we chop from there,
- If market pumps into the data and is rapidly faded, if shorting you usually don't want to see the highs printed during that leg retested => If that happens it often means that the retrace of the move was a fake out AND/OR that at **least** we chop from there.

TL;DR: Have a plan ready for both directions, your main levels mapped out, let FOMC + Powell speech play out, and decide after if you want to trade the leftovers or not.

### **Using 25 EMA as an LTF/MTF Trend Indicator**

Using 25 EMA on the D1 and H4 time frame can be very telling if a trend is going to continue or not, both are very good trend indicators from my experience.

And you can clearly see it on most altcoins, after any sort of dump, there are always two types of alts:

- Those who held their Short/mid term trend (D1 25 EMA),
- Those who didn't.

**Here are a few examples of coins who did, and those who didn't:**

- **SOL/BTC - D1 :**

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/b0c69a72-f7ee-4739-8322-dc664883ea00/full)

**Now a few examples of coins who didn't:**

- **AION/BTC - D1 :**

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/dfecde98-a178-4dad-2932-9bef912f5500/full)

**Here are 4 examples of this educational content, this time on the way down as the above content was in context of general uptrend.**

I took the examples of very trending coins: UNI, YFI, SPX and LINK.

On different time frames, all of them gave us nice exits when they lost the couple of EMA: 25 / 13.

On UNI/USDT, we exited the top around $8 as shared here, and we avoided FOMOing back into a position as soon as the H1 25/13 EMA cluster was lost and flipped resistance. Updated it here a few times to mention I had no business re entering until structure was reclaimed.

On YFI/USDT, it also gave us a very clean exit, this time on H4 and in the 40k as it lost the H4 25/13 EMA cluster. After that, YFI gave a nice bounce and half CT was already saying bottom was in while we were mentioning that H4 25/13 EMA haven't been reclaimed yet and that there was no rush to FOMO (this was the local top of the bounce).

On SPX... The chart speaks for itself:

**Note:** Moving Averages are indicators. They are nothing more than that. They are very useful to smooth a chart, to highlight trend and especially shift in trends but they remain indicators.

They have a big part in my trading system but there is nothing magical about them. There are not magic EMA/MA, no magic crosses whatsoever. They're only math and a way to smooth the chart/price over time and give a "cleaner" idea of a trend.

Keep this in mind please, it's important to always understand they're only indicators. Very useful ones when used correctly, but just indicators at the end of the day.

**Another very good example of the strength of 13/25 EMA short-term trend indicator:**

### **Spotting Trend Reversals Early**

Just wanted to share this LUN/BTC chart as another perfect example on the importance of high time frame MA/EMA to spot trend reversal / end of accumulation area.

Once again as you can see on the left of the chart, the gap between majors EMA/MA (25/200 - 100/200/300) was WAY too high for any possible rally to be sustainable: the trend still hasn't reset since last big move, and the coin isn't ready.

After a few months of accumulation and bottoming process majors EMA/MA gaps have tighten: all of them share the same value = the trend has reset and we MIGHT be ready for an impulse/trend reversal.

In these kind of setups, looking for 200d EMA (black stairs on the chart) is very often a good way to enter these coins: wait for it to be broken and retested. If it held, enter the coin and use the EMA as invalidation level. Especially in cases like this one where it's absolutely perfect and not only 200d EMA is sitting there but also 100/200/300d MA.

Please keep this example in mind for every time I'll talk about high time frame trend reversal structure.

**LUN/BTC - D1:**

### **Chasing Gaps - Countertrend Scalps**

**GAP FILL SETUPS - LONG/SHORT COUNTER TREND SCALPS**

=> Long in D1 downtrend

=> Short in D1 uptrend

- Conditions =
1. Above/Below H1/H4 trend
2. Wide gaps to play above/below
- Entry = On H1/H4 trends flip/retests
- Invalidation = On H1/H4 trends loss (failure to flip)
- Target = H4 100 MA/H4 200 EMA i.e D1 trend retests from below/above

**They usually unfold such as:**

1. H4 trend breaks (trigger)‬
2. H4 trend flipped (entry)‬
3. H4 trend -> H4 100 MA gap filled (Target #1)‬
4. h4 trend x H4 100 MA compression (compounding?)‬
5. 5a. H4 trend breaks first, chop at best, retrace otherwise (out)‬

‪ 5b. H4 100 MA breaks first, next gap fill to H4 200 EMA (Target #2)‬

**Reminder:**

When taking a trade counter trending a high time frame trend, you want several conditions:

- H4 trend reclaimed and defended,
- H4 100 MA & H4 200 EMA as your main targets,

=> They represent the trend on higher time frame, as you’re long within D1 downtrend you must pay yourself when retesting D1 downtrend

- Wide gaps between H4 trend and H4 100 MA & H4 200 EMA

=> The wider the gaps mean the most interesting the setup because the bigger the move to capture

Therefore it’s perfectly fine to long/short on H4 within up/down trends on D1, but you just need big gaps (come after big moves in high time frame trend direction -> meaning that you’ll get big gaps on H4 after a strong/brutal D1 trend to play with.

It’s really just all about playing gaps, if you’ve been studying and paying attention to my system/content and particularly all the "trend x compression" patterns discussed above, then it makes perfect sense.

**Some gap fill examples**

1. Strong trend

2. Lose trend

3. Trend gets disrespected

4. 100 MA retest

5. 100 MA defended

6. 100 MA lost

7. 100 MA + trend flipped resistance

8. Fill the gaps

    for me something that's not respecting
    
    **0:01**
    
    H4 Trend like this for example if the
    
    **0:03**
    
    Gap to h41 were still in the 3K region I
    
    **0:06**
    
    feel like you could give it a try and
    
    **0:08**
    
    try to play with a wider stop because
    
    **0:11**
    
    you could afford it with a bigger Gap
    
    **0:13**
    
    above but with The Gap being smaller and
    
    **0:14**
    
    smaller the smaller it gets the more
    
    **0:17**
    
    your wide stop turns your trade into a
    
    **0:19**
    
    vastly shittier one and the risk reward
    
    **0:21**
    
    is just not good enough there are almost
    
    **0:23**
    
    no situations on me where I would be

    willing to disrespect H4 Trend and I
    
    **0:27**
    
    would say even less during the summer
    
    **0:29**
    
    like this there is very little reasons
    
    **0:31**
    
    for me to disrespect H4 Trend especially
    
    **0:33**
    
    if the goal is to play along trying to
    
    **0:35**
    
    capture a gap field while the daily

    **0:39**
    
    pretty much the conclusion on Tuesday
    
    **0:41**
    
    stream it was that on H4 I could
    
    **0:43**
    
    understand people trying to chase the

    Gap field even if for me was a very
    
    **0:46**
    
    complicated one to chase because where
    
    **0:48**
    
    would you place your stops or do you
    
    **0:50**
    
    want to manage h41 catching down this
    
    **0:52**
    
    rapidly and just basically retesting
    

### **Reversal/Bottom Structure Alpha**

I've been discussing this topic a lot in here since the launch of The Haven as I believe this is an approach of trading based on moving averages that many people aren't using/understanding fully - yet "mathematically" (core definition of MA/EMA is simply an average of the price over a period of time defined) the main use of them.

Krillin shared a chart earlier of ONG/BTC, that looks like this (with notes so you can understand what I'm referring to below):

[](https://imagedelivery.net/0TUhygZf3NbTC43eT6oVHg/b5dd1283-7586-49a2-04f6-b579eb627200/full)

As you can see, the structure is very interesting and if you've been in this group since launch or/and following Krillin and me for quite some time you should recognize the type of setups we very often like to enter swings.

The "typical" structure of these kind of reversal happen after a MASSIVE previous trend that took months to year to reset (2015-2018 massive altcoins bull run). It creates massive gaps between major moving averages (100,200,300 daily) and as long as these gaps exist and are this big, it's hard to expect any kind of move to be sustainable.

OGN is yet another very good example with multiple reversal attempts denied over the last 12 months (and very often by..... wait for it.....**200d EMA)**

After multiple months of "resetting", where the coin usually build a strong floor, and have some movements, we often see the attempts of exiting the accumulation/compression area (green box in the chart) to be closer and closer in time until we finally see a first impulse.

Two options then:

1) Either this impulse is followed/coupled by strong FA/events and they can run quite hard - be the real HTF reversal,

2) Either they tend to fade and eventually retest the accumulation/compression area.

In the example of ONG/BTC, this first impulse was quite clean and quite important but eventually it went for option #2, and didn't managed to hold 200d EMA (lack of FA/events confluence?).

So now what ?

Well the opportunity is still there, the coin is back at a major horizontal level to hold and very often in confluence with cluster of major moving averages. It gives a clear invalidation and therefore the possibility for new setups.

Two options for these kind of setups.

1) You accumulate as long as price is compressed between 200d EMA and 200/300d MA, and you have the patience to wait for an impulse outside of the compression/accumulation area. Hard to time, but the tighter the gap between 200D EMA and 200/300D MA the sooner the impulse from my experience,

2) You wait for the impulse outside of the compression area and you hope for a retest of the range high that is very often in confluence with 200d EMA and you snipe an entry there.

These kind of setups gave us some very nice returns (from x2 to x5) earlier this year on coins like DASH, XZC, AION, ... Same in Q2/Q3 with coins like ZIL, XLM, ALGO...

**NOTE:** Some coins are dead, and might never actually have a second impulse/exit these bottom areas as they remain... dead. These kind of setups obviously don't have 100% strike rate but they give time for accumulation with very often tight and clear invalidation (be careful with wicks tho!).

### **Reversal EMA/MA Structure Continued**

Another great example of Market reversal EMA/MA structure, but this time on lower TF: H4

Feb 2021 BTC H4 PA has been a perfect example of H4 EMA/MA compression into impulse/trend; into reversal/reset.

Very important to understand this if you're aiming to focus on riding trends in this market.

### **Using HTF Trends to Ride Momentum**

Using Moving Averages in order to find trends on high time frame - **LINK/USDT D1 and YFI/USDT H4 Examples**

As everybody knows here one of the main reason I'm using moving averages, from low time frame to high time frame, is to understand trends better and ride them.

This often means I won't be a "bottom" or "top" chaser, but I'll most likely very often find a way to make money in the middle.

I just wanted to share with you all this LINK/USDT D1 chart where I've highlighted the importance of the D1 13/25 EMA couple and how it could be used to scale into positions and ride trends.

### **Compressions**

**Examples of trend x 100 MA/200 EMA compression patterns**

You'll very often see me talking about "classic trend x 100 MA compression" patterns... Because we see this everywhere. You probably noticed on most of my shorts, the entry is on retest of trend from below, aiming for gap fill down to 100 MA. This is a pattern that keeps repeating. On all TF and on all assets.

Some other examples:

I’ve been showing and sharing examples of these kind of compressions on 15 min to W1 charts, from most obscure shit coins to DXY. There is not ONE stream without showing/discussing an example of it. And MOST of the SETUPS, SHORTS OR LONGS you’ll see me taking are based on this pattern.

Which makes total sense because **it’s triggered first by a loss of trend == willing to short.**

And then it’s ideal cause it automatically comes with clear invalidation and target:

- Condition: trend lost
- Invalidation: trend reclaimed
- Target: 100 MA/200 EMA gap fill

And **obviously** you can apply this to bottoming process too:

1) Strong downtrend,

2) Trend breaks, you have 100 MA / 200 EMA above (See BTC Jan 2023 PA as example)

3) Long into trend reclaim aiming for gap fills higher

It really represents a BIG part of my trading, and you can find these kind of patterns everywhere really. So learning to spot it (SUPER EASY, JUST 3 MOVING AVERAGES) can be very interesting IMO, and should help you understanding my approach MUCH better.

If you’re studying my system, it’s **crucial** that you learn to recognize these kind of patterns/behaviors. It’s incredibly useful to spot first signals of weakness/strength and trade them.

This short is the perfect example once again:

- Entered on loss of trend + horizontal support
- Goal was to take some off at 100 MA,
- It came for 100 MA perfectly, bounced into trend and got denied -> At this point I could have compounded,
- You can clearly see the compression,
- Lost 100 MA, therefore aiming for the next gap; last target being 200 EMA.

When I say this approach/pattern represents > 75% of my trading, I mean it :).

**All I do is chasing trend reclaims/losses and trade gaps above/below.**

**Sharing this DXY W1 chart because it just displays my entire system and focuses perfectly:**

1. Super strong trend

2. Loss of trend == first signal of weakness

3. Full loss of trend == top is in

4. Came for the retest of lost trend from below several times

5. Filled gap to 100 MA

6. Bounce into trend and get denied

7. 100 MA x Trend compression

8. 100 MA lost

9. Fill the gap to 200 EMA instantly

This is just 100% of what we're chasing on shitcoins from H1 to D1 TF. This is everywhere and just perfectly beautiful.

### **Mastering Key Trend Trading Setups - The EMA/MA Compression**

**Mastering Key Trend Trading Setups: EMA/MA Compression, Trend Following, and Gap Fills (Counter Trend) Strategies**

**Introduction**

In the next three lessons, I will walk you through the three main setups that form the foundation of my trading strategy:

1. EMA/MA Compression setups
2. Trend Following setups
3. Gap Fills (Counter Trend) setups

Each of these setups serves a distinct purpose and is effective in different market conditions. These strategies often work together in a sequence, helping traders position themselves effectively as trends unfolds and reverses:

1. **The EMA/MA Compression** setup’s main goal is to avoid periods of consolidation and to try taking position before a continuation of an existing trend or a trend shift, following a period of consolidation or market reset.
2. **The Trend Following** setup’s main goal is to recognize halts within established trends and maximize these to (ideally after an EMA/MA compression) compound on positions or get exposure, with defined conditions for exit strategies.
3. **The Gap Fill** setup’s main goal is to spot the end or a pause in trendy behavior and capture its definitive (or temporary) reversal (back into potential EMA/MA compression development). The goal of this article is to explain how to identify and trade each of these setups, offering detailed templates and examples to guide you.

The first lesson is on **EMA/MA Compression Setups**

EMA/MA compression based setups are my main focus when it comes to positioning for swings after long periods of consolidation/ranging (relative to the TF you're focused on). They are great indicator of complete market reset before potential new breakouts or trend shifts.

**The main goals of EMA/MA compression approach are to:**

1. Judge whether a longer period of range/consolidation can take place, and therefore to avoid over trading consolidating price action
2. Time positioning more effectively (not too early, basically) before a breakout or trend shift appears, building a base for Trend Following approach then

EMA/MA compression setups usually precede Trend Following setups, the ideal situation being:

1. Build main/swing position early based on a EMA/MA compression setup
2. Compound on main position using Trend Following setups
3. Exit/trim position/adjust trading approach at first signs of end of trendy behavior (into third category of setups discussed later in the article, Gap Fills setups)

In this lesson, I'll explain what is a EMA/MA compression, and I'll give you a template setup of how to trade them with one example.

**What is a EMA/MA compression?**

One of the result of a strong period of trending is the gaps between main moving averages (Trend, 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA) getting bigger:

- The more the price moves in one direction, the bigger the distance will be between these main moving averages
- The bigger the distance between these main moving averages is when trend breaks, the more we're likely to see gap fills into a period of consolidation following
- The longer the consolidation, the smaller the distance between these main moving averages gets... **resulting in a EMA/MA compression**

*This is your signal to expect a breakout or trend shift, and therefore look to build bigger positions again (compared to - for example - mostly chasing Gap Fills)*

**The two main indicators of potential incoming EMA/MA compression are therefore:**

1. The end of a strong trending behavior
    - *Using BTCUSD D1 example attached, you can spot the end of the trendy behavior in the black rectangle*
    - *Usually end of trendy behavior translates into a close below trend, into trend then flipped resistance or "disrespected" (lost, reclaimed, lost,...)*
    - *A great indicator to spot whether the trend you're focusing on is lost/reclaimed can be TF-1 200 EMA, meaning: if focused on D1 trend, monitoring whether H4 200 EMA is defended or not, if focused on H4 trend, monitoring whether H1 200 EMA is defended or not.*
2. Wide gaps between 100 MA, 200 EMA and 300 MA
    - *Using BTCUSD D1 example attached, we can see that at the moment D1 trend started to break for the first time we had: D1 100 MA @ ~56k, D1 200 EMA @ ~49k, D1 300 MA @ ~40k)*
    - *Indicating first, a good potential for gap fills setups, but also that it would require time for these gaps to tighten, and therefore potential incoming longer period of consolidation*

**Template of an EMA/MA Compression based setup:**

Conditions =

1. Gaps between 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA reduced, the tighter the better (the more it translates the complete reset of previous trendy behavior)
2. 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA flat (ideally starting to curve up/down depending if looking for longs/shorts)

**Entry** = On retest of the confluence of 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA. *=> Can start scaling from 100 MA to 300 MA, an average ideal goal entry being as close as possible to 200 EMA.*

*You're usually in no rush when trading EMA/MA compressions and taking a bet on next direction, therefore deciding to scale slowly and increase if direction picked goes your way.*

**Invalidation** = Incapacity to hold above 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA.

*Can be a manual invalidation.*

*I usually like to use recent lows/highs printed for confluence for SL placement while giving it some room to deviate sub compression*.

Confirmation/Trigger to increase exposure = Following EMA/MA compression, ideally you want to see trend being respected and use it as additional confirmation to increase exposure or not.

*Using BTCUSD D1 example attached, you can spot D1 trend being defended after D1 EMA/MA compression retest*

*If - for any reason/context - you're not willing to play the compression retest in itself, it's perfectly fine also to focus on Trend retest following as a confirmation to position yourself* -

**Target #1** = I usually like to use the retest of the recent consolidation Range High/Low as first main target

**Target #2** = "Whenever/wherever trend breaks"

*Following EMA/MA compression, the main expectation is to see a new trend forming, therefore goal is to ride new trend as high/low as it gets, after taking first profits on retest of highs/lows, the next exit can be whenever/wherever trend breaks again*

### **Mastering Key Trend Trading Setups - The Trend Following Setup**

(see Video on Whop)

If you are more of a visual/audio learner, I’ve added a video to go alongside the teachings below. It should help solidify your understanding of the trend following setup!

**Mastering Key Trend Trading Setups - The Trend Following Setup**

As a trend/momentum trader, Trend Following setups are obviously a core component of my trading strategy. These setups represent trades taken during conditions where the trend-following system is supposed to be most effective, and therefore, the periods where I should be the most active in the market.

As outlined in the previous chapter, these setups are often used to compound existing positions that were taken during an EMA/MA compression phase. This doesn't have to be always the case obviously, this can be applied to any on-going trend (example attached to this chapter is an example where we missed the initial impulse as EMA/MA compression wasn't clean)

**Goals of Trend Following Setups:**

The primary objectives when executing a Trend Following setup are:

- Identify temporary halts in the trend: This allows for entry points where the market is taking a brief pause, and provides an opportunity to position yourself for the continuation of the trend.
- Ride the trend and compound your positions effectively: Once the trend resumes, the goal is to ride it and compound the original position to maximize profits.

In this lesson, I’ll explain what constitutes an “Ideal Trend Continuation Development” and provide a template to help you identify and trade these setups effectively, with one example to illustrate the process.

**What is an "Ideal Trend Continuation Development"?**

An Ideal Trend Continuation Development occurs when the market experiences a temporary pullback or consolidation before the trend continues.

Here are the key indicators that signal such development:

1. Wide Gap Between Price and Trend:
- A large gap between price and the trend line often signals that the market has made a significant move, resulting in an overextended price.
- The larger the gap, the more likely we are to see a period of consolidation to close this gap before the trend can continue (or reverse if trend not defended).
1. StochRSI at Extreme Positions:
- In an uptrend, look for StochRSI to be overbought, indicating that the trend may need to cool off.
- In a downtrend, look for StochRSI to be oversold, signaling a potential pause or reversal in the trend.

**Ideal Trend Continuation Development:**

An Ideal Trend Continuation Development is the combination of the following conditions:

1. Horizontal Level Flipped/Defended:
- *If you’re in an uptrend, the market should defend a previous resistance level (now acting as support).*
- *If you’re in a downtrend, the market should defend a previous support level (now acting as resistance).*
- *These levels can also be derived from previous local highs or lows within the trend if no previous PA to work with (price discovery situation for example)*
1. Trend Catching Up/Down with Horizontal Level AND defended
2. Stoch RSI Resetting (from overbought to oversold in uptrend, from oversold to overbought in downtrend)

**Template for Trend Following Setup Following "Ideal Trend Continuation Development":**

- **Conditions** = All three conditions mentioned in definition above
- **Entry** = As close as possible to confluence of Horizontal level & H4 trend
- **Invalidation** = On incapacity to hold/flip confluence of Horizontal level & H4 trend
- **Target #1** = Local high (in uptrend)/low (in downtrend)
- **Target #2** = As high (in uptrend)/low (in downtrend) as trend develops
- ***Exit when trend starts to break.***

### **Mastering Key Trend Trading Setups - The Gap Fill (Counter Trend)**

(see Video on Whop)

Gap Fills represent the final step in the trend-following process. As discussed previously in the article, after a strong trend gaps often form between the key moving averages (Trend, 100 MA, 200 EMA, 300 MA). A "gap fill" occurs when the market retraces to fill these gaps, which can signal the end of a trend or the beginning of a new consolidation phase.

The main goal of Gap Fills setups is therefore to capture the moves between these gaps, and maximize trend trading by capturing temporary or permanent reversal. Indeed, Gap Fills setups can be useful in different scenarios/contexts depending on their outcomes:

1. Complete end of trend into reversal (all gaps filled down to 300 MA)
2. Temporary halt of trend into continuation (one or two gaps filled before trend reclaim and continuation)

I find them extremely useful in every TF. Focusing on them on H4/D1 when swinging, focusing on them on 15 min/H1 when trading spikes of volatility (to time and capture local reversals within bigger moves).

In this lesson, I'll explain how these gap fills usually unfold "step by step" with two different examples of the two main outcomes, and I'll give you a template setup of how to trade them.

**The usual development of Gap Fills (applicable to any TF):**

1. Strong trend breaks
- *See discussion above about what development and indicators can constitute a trend break*
1. Trend flips resistance
2. Trend -> 100 MA gap fill
3. 100 MA x Trend compression

*This is where the two outcomes differentiate*

5a. 100 MA breaks, into 100 MA -> 200 EMA gap fill

- *Repeat process with 200 EMA x trend compression, into 300 MA gap fill if 200 EMA lost*
- *This is the case of the SUI/USDT D1 example shared*

5b. 100 MA defended, Trend reclaim -> Trend continuation (at least retest of the highs)

- *This is the case of the BTC/USDT D1 example shared*

**Template for Gap Fill setup:**

If trading Gap Fills, it means you're:

Looking for longs within higher TF downtrend (i.e looking for H4 longs within D1 downtrend, D1 longs within W1 downtrends, ...)

- Looking for shorts within higher TF uptrend (i.e looking for H4 shorts within D1 uptrend, D1 shorts within W1 uptrends, ...)

**Conditions** =

1. Trend lost and flipped resistance
2. Wide gaps to chase above/below
- *Indeed, for the Gap Fill setups to be worth it, the gaps need to be big enough. Basically, the longer we consolidate, the smaller the gaps are, the less interesting it becomes to play such gaps*
- *This is why Gap Fill setups tend to be the most interesting at end of trend and at the beginning of ranging conditions*
- **Entry** = On retest of trend, ideally if there is a previous support flipped resistance (or opposite) use it
- **Invalidation** = On close back above Trend
- *This can always be a fake out, most often it's preferable to take a step back and let things unfold*
- *Trend reclaim remains the invalidation at any point of the trade, whether it's after filling gaps or not*

**Target #1** = 100 MA

- *If/when 100 MA lost, you can compound applying same principle, your invalidation then becomes "Trend x 100 MA reclaim*
- **Target #2** = 200 EMA
- *If/when 200 EMA lost, you can compound applying same principle, your invalidation then becomes "Trend x 200 EMA reclaim*

**Target #3** = 300 MA
